The late 1950s and early 1960s were a time of profoundgrowth for the civil rights movement in the United States.Although racial segregation in the public schools had been
outlawed in 1954, the ruling applied only to this one category ofdiscriminatory practice in U.s. society. But it furthered withinthe African-American community the anticipation of broaderchanges. lt was in this climate that the student sit-in
demonstrations of the early 1960s were born. The technique ofthe sit-in was simpleâ€”African Americans occupying "whitesonly" seats in racially segregated establishments-but this newtype of student activism galvanized established civil rights
organizations, brought about the creation of new ones, andgenerated support for the civil rights movement among manynew segments of the populace.
lnitiated by four students of the North Carolina Agriculturaland Technical College, the first sit-in occurred at a lunchcounter in February 1960. Sit-ins then spread rapidly throughthe southern U.s., involving over 70,000 participants by August1961.The sit-ins provided an important model for nonviolentprotest and showed students that they could affect the politicalprocess.The influence of these demonstrations on the
determination of the student activists was particularly visible intwo events: the formation of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, and the birth of a second form of sit-ins called Freedom Rides.
The formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee followed the first sit-in by just a few months and notonly solidified student involvement in the civil rights movementbut also placed students in leadership roles for the first time. Itoperated independently of other civil rights organizations andrelied on strong local leadership, helping to transform studentinvolvement from participation in small-scale protests into asustained effort to challenge discrimination throughout the U.s.But the development that marked the clearest turning point forthe civil rights movement was the Freedom Rides.The goal ofthe rides, which were organized in 1961 by the already well-established Congress of Racial Equality, was to challengesegregation through the occupation of "whites only" seats oninterstate buses and in facilities at the various terminals atwhich the buses stopped. Because the rides inspired violentreprisals in some regions, the u.s. government began usingforce to protect the safety of the Freedom Riders; this was thefirst government action taken explicitly in support of the causeof desegregation outside the public schools.The Freedom
Rides thus helped take the civil rights movement to a new levelby underscoring to the u.s. government, and to U.S. societygenerally, the harsh realities of the segregation system, and byproviding, for students and their elders alike, examples of themethods they might use to achieve a more equal society.
